# Bikesharing

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the viability of a bikesharing business in DesMoines, IA, based on data from a successful enterprise in New York City. The whole Tableau story may be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joel5248/viz/BikesharingDeliverable2/Story1?publish=yes

### Visualization 1
This line graph demonstrates that the vast majority of rides are less than an hour. I would suggest that most people are using the bikes to reach a particular destination, rather than taking bike tours of the city.

### Visualization 2
This graph reveals the same pattern across all genders; with the vast majority of renters being male.

### Visualization 3
On weekdays, 8am is the busiest start time, while weekends tend to favor later times. In New York, the largest city in the US, people are probably using bikes to get to work. DesMoines may see different patterns, as it is much more of an automobile-oriented city without such a robust public transportation system.

### Visualization 4
Again, the same pattern is seen across different genders.

### Visualization 5
This visualization highlights the huge majority of subscribers who rent in NYC. This, again, will likely not be the same in DesMoines. Subscribers are most likely local customers who use the bikes on a regular basis. This makes sense in New York, where it is advantageous not to own a car if one can avoid it. DesMoines, however, is inhabited almost entirely by car owners. It is entirely possible that DesMoines could see the same imbalance in user types in favor of one-time customers.

### Visualization 6
This bar graph shows us the peak hours of usage, which are 8am and 5-6pm. This would seem to confirm my earlier assertion that most riders are using the bikes to get to work. It doesn't prove the idea, but it is suggestive.

### Visualization 7
These maps show the most popular starting and ending locations. There is little difference in the two maps, which center not only on the top tourist destinations but also the primary business centers of the city. So, as stated, we cannot prove the theory that most renters are locals taking the bikes to work. More data is needed.

## Further Observations and Data requirements

It would also be helpful to see a comparison of the average trip duration according to user type, and also the starting and ending locations according to user type. This might give us more information regarding tourist use vs local use.

New York City and DesMoines are radically different cities. To really determine the viability of a business in DesMoines based on data from New York, we need a lot more information. We need to know more about tourism in DesMoines. What percentage of tourists fly to DesMoines, and what percentage drive? This might tell us something about the likelihood of establishing a solid base of renters. We could also look at car rental information to gain some idea of how many people need this service.
