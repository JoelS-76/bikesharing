# bikesharing

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the viability of a bikesharing business in DesMoines, IA, based on data from a successful enterprise in New York City.

### Visualization 1
This line graph demonstrates that the vast majority of rides are less than an hour. I would suggest that most people are using the bikes to reach a particular destination, rather than taking bike tours of the city.

### Visualization 2
This graph reveals the same pattern across all genders; with the vast majority of renters being male.

### Visualization 3
On weekdays, 8am is the busiest start time, while weekends tend to favor later times. In New York, the largest city in the US, people are probably using bikes to get to work. DesMoines may see different patterns, as it is much more of an automobile-oriented city without such a robust public transportation system.

### Visualization 4
Again, the same pattern is seen across different genders.

### Visualization 5
This visualization highlights the huge majority of subscribers who rent in NYC. This, again, will likely not be the same in DesMoines. Subscribers are most likely local customers who use the bikes on a regular basis. This makes sense in New York, where it is advantageous not to own a car if one can avoid it. DesMoines, however, is inhabited almost entirely by car owners, and will therefore see far more balance between subscribers and one-time customers. It is entirely possible that DesMoines could see the same imbalance in user types in favor of one-time customers.
